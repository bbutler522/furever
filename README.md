# furever
A free open source website solution for animal shelters. The goal is to make it as easy as possible for shelters to list adoptable pets, and get potential adopters into the shelters.

The intent is to have a responsive modern design that is user friendly from any device. A database will be created that shelters can use to add animals and manage them, updating the site in real-time. For shelters that have an existing system, it should be possible for them to either continue using their current system or to import the information via an importer.
